# Genetic Neural Network - Flappy bird

Very small nerual network with a genetic algorithm that learns to play flappy bird. Used game engine <a href="https://phaser.io">Phaser</a>. Currently spawns 10 birds per round and only uses random crossover with a mutation rate of 5%. More crossover methods will be tested in the future. Project is compiled to single minified js with <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. For computation <a href="http://mathjs.org">Math.js</a> and <a href="http://chancejs.com">ChanceJs</a> were used.
